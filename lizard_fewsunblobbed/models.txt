Model tests
===========

    >>> from lizard_fewsunblobbed import models

Basic instantiation and printing:

    >>> filter_ = models.Filter()
    >>> filter_
    <Filter:  (id=)>
    >>> filter_.name = 'Sample filter'
    >>> filter_.fews_id = '1234'
    >>> filter_
    <Filter: Sample filter (id=1234)>
