Making a sqlite database with data
----------------------------------

how to make a sqlite fews-unblobbed database

# sqlite3 filename.db
SQLite version 3.6.16
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> .read import.sql
SQL error near line 11: no such table: filter
SQL error near line 12: no such table: location
SQL error near line 13: no such table: parameter
SQL error near line 14: no such table: timeserie
SQL error near line 15: no such table: timeseriedata
sqlite> 

(finished! - it gives the errors because if you have existing tables,
the script will remove the tables first)


Usage:

    >>> import lizard_fewsunblobbed

Show how to import the main classes and how to use them.

Smoketest
    >>> from lizard_fewsunblobbed.models import *
    >>> from lizard_fewsunblobbed import views

    >>> Filter.objects.all()
    []

    >>> Location.objects.all()
    []

    >>> Parameter.objects.all()
    []

    >>> Timeserie.objects.all()
    []

    >>> Timeseriedata.objects.all()
    []

If you're using multiple databases, you can use the 'using' thingy

    >>> Filter.objects.using('fews-waternet').all()
    []

However it's better to create a django router if there's only one fews
unblobbed database available...
