===================================================


0.6 (unreleased)
----------------

- Using django's cache framework to cache the expensive filter tree (currently
  for 8 hours).

- Huge speed increase for the parameter list as we're using django's ``__``
  tricks in the query now instead of looping by hand.

- Added Timeserie display/search caching.


0.5 (2010-06-23)

  all interaction.

  approach.
