----------------

- Django-treebeard: we need 1.61 minimum.

- Fixed up the models: no more TextFields where we really need charfields.

  treebeard.


1.0 (2010-08-30)

  id. This fixes a bug when first viewing a graph in a temp workspace.


0.6 (2010-06-23)
----------------

- Using django's cache framework to cache the expensive filter tree (currently
  for 8 hours).

- Huge speed increase for the parameter list as we're using django's ``__``
  tricks in the query now instead of looping by hand.

- Added Timeserie display/search caching.


0.5 (2010-06-23)
----------------

- Using lizard-ui's ajax loading and lizard-map's generic workspace drag/drop
  now.  This means we can render a full fews-browser page ourselves including
  all interaction.

- Switched layer display and search functions to lizard-map's new adapter
  approach.
